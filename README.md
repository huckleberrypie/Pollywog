# Pollywog - The LeapFrog Epic Toolbox
Just a minimal utilities menu for LeapFrog Epic, the purpose being to unlock a number of hidden yet useful options that were present in vanilla AOSP but disabled for some reason by LeapFrog.
Think of it as like a watered down ROM Toolbox of sorts, but tailor-made for LeapFrog's Android tablet. I came up with this as switching to another hotspot is a bit of a chore, so yeah. I know it's simple and all, and my Java skills leave a lot to be desired, but I hope this would be of some use to you guys.

## Features
* Shortcuts to commonly-used and some advanced Android features (WLAN and previously hidden stuff like the MTK engineer menu, lockscreens and developer options)
* A link to the LeapFrog support page
* And many more being planned

## Planned stuff
* A root exploit perhaps?
* Cache cleaner
* A terminal emulator
* Enhancements to the parental controls/restrictions feature (considering how these can be bypassed somewhat :P)
